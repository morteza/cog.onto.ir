How do we decide what we perceive? Obviously, we base our decisions on sensory evidence. However, a new and surprising study by Hagura et al. (2017) shows that our perceptual decisions are also biased by the action costs that are associated with our decisions.

Hagura et al. (2017) found that participants subsequently showed a tendency to avoid decisions for the motion direction that was associated with the energetically more-costly motor response. Crucially, after the induction of asymmetric motor response costs for manual responses, participants showed a similar bias when indicating their decisions vocally. This transfer of the bias onto decisions reported with a different effector – for which motor response costs were not manipulated – suggests that the repeated exposure to motor response costs associated with a particular decision can bias future perceptual decisions themselves.
