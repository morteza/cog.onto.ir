Decoupled from sensory and motor signals, neural activities can also represent and replay past and possible future states (e.g., in memory consolidation, imaginations, learning, planning, and decision-making). Studies in rodent hippocampus show decoupled neural activities occur in form of internally-generated coherent sequences that encode trajectories through past or future states of spatial tasks. Not yet well-understood, these fast sequences may be a fundamental feature of neural computation across spatial and no-spatial tasks. From physiological perspective, this phenomenon is embedded within sharp-wave ripple events, or nested within theta rhythm. However, these sequences have only been studied in the context of spatial tasks in rodents, and never in humans.

Kurth-Nelson et al. (2016) found similar sequences not only in human, but also for non-spatial tasks. They conducted a three-phase study: First, they recorded MEG signals of human subjects during a novel non-spatial reasoning task. The task was designed so corresponding neural representations could be decoded. Secondly they trained a classifier during a setting where subjects were presented with visual objects. Finally they recorded MEG signals and tested the trained classifiers with no object presented. During the final phase, the brain spontaneously visited representations of approximately four objects in reversed sequences, lasting on the order of 120 milliseconds.


Overall, they argue such sequences are a ubiquitous mechanism, might be analogous to the rodent hippocampal findings, and can be measured non-invasively in humans.
